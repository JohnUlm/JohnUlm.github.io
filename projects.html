                        <p>FEB 23 - APR 23</p>
                        <p>I worked in a team of four to create a fully autonomous robot over one semester. The robot was coded in C and featured the use of optosensor line-following, 
                            CdS cells, bump switches, and shaft encoding to navigate. I primarily worked on electrical connections, budgeting, and SolidWorks design although I contributed to
                            construction and coding.

                            Originally this site was supposed to be finished over Spring Break 2023 however the scope of this project is
                            continually expanding.

                            This is a little game I made with C# in the Unity game engine. All sprite work was made by me
                            using GIMP. The game features two player controls and a simple scoring system.
