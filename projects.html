                        <p>FEB 23 - APR 23</p>
                        <p>I worked in a team of four to create a fully autonomous robot over one semester. The robot was coded in C and featured the use of optosensor line-following, 
                            CdS cells, bump switches, and shaft encoding to navigate. I primarily worked on electrical connections, budgeting, and SolidWorks design although I contributed to
                            construction and coding. A playlist of two of the runs can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuSji2DPxwjk-GbdYrSakBTazWIhc332R">here</a>.

                        <p>This is the website that you are on right now. This site was created from scratch using only HTML and CSS.
                            This site was designed to help me understand a bit more about the front-end process of webdev as well as a site to put a summary of my projects.
                            Originally this site was supposed to be finished over Spring Break 2023 however the scope of this project is
                            continually expanding.

                            This is a little game I made with C# in the Unity game engine. All sprite work was made by me
                            using GIMP. The game features two player controls and a simple scoring system. The game utilizes
                            the built in physics engine with minor improvements to help the "game feel".

                        <p>A partner and I created a video game written in C++ and the OSU proteus simulator. 
                            The game features real time physics and sprite-based graphics.

                        <p>JAN 22 - APR 22</p>
                        <p>
                            In high school a team and I created a wooden claw powered by hydraulic 
                            pistons. The claw was designed to pick up both empty and full soda cans.
                            Mechanically the claw was similar to an excavator though it involved the use of a counterweight for balance.
                            The claw was controlled through an arduino with the use of four joysticks.
                            Unfortunately no photo exists.

                        <p>
                            In high school a partner and I worked to create a structurally strong prototype bridge
                            made of fettuccine. The bridge was designed to be lightweight and use very little materials.
                            Despite having the lightest bridge the bridge still performed similarly to much more expensive designs.
